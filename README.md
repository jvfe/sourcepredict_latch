## Sourcepredict

Sourcepredict[^1] is a Python package distributed through Conda,
to classify and predict the origin of metagenomic samples,
given a reference dataset of known origins, a problem also known as
source tracking. Sourcepredict solves this problem by using machine
learning classification on dimensionally reduced datasets.
